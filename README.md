Modules for the [a3g framework](https://github.com/a3g/a3g-framework)

#TLDR
Use the [framework](https://github.com/a3g/a3g-framework), it does the complicated stuff for you, all it does is take these modules and apply them correctly.

#Manual install
If you're adamant on not using the framework, you have the option of using each of the modules, or however many you want, without it. Each module has different instructions on how to properly apply them to your mission, which is why they should all have a `README.md` inside their folder.
The modules are designed to sit in a folder appropriately named `modules` in the mission root directory. Example:
- `mymission.Takistan\modules\modulename`
That's because you may use quite a few of them, which would very quickly clutter up the mission root folder.

#Contributing
