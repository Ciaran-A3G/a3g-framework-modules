Modules for the [a3g framework](https://github.com/a3g/a3g-framework)

#TLDR
Use the framework, it does the complicated stuff for you, all it does is take these modules and apply them correctly.

#Manual install
If you're adamant on not using the framework, you have the option of using each of the modules, or however many you want, without the framework. Each module has different instructions on how to properly apply them to your mission, which is why they should all have a readme inside their module folder.
The modules are designed to sit in a folder called `modules` in the mission root directory. Example:
- `mymission.Takistan\modules\modulename`
That's because they are encapsulated entirely modular and some of them don't have that much functionality, which would very quickly clutter up the mission root folder if you use a lot of them.
